* [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) - Just go use thier debugger until you fully understand how simple JWTs are.
* [Dr Philippe De Ryck](https://pragmaticwebsecurity.com/about.html) has lot of great stuff around JWT Security. A few good examples are:
  * [The hard parts of JWT security nobody talks about](https://pragmaticwebsecurity.com/articles/apisecurity/hard-parts-of-jwt.html) and [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPrhem174Ws).
  * [7 Ways to Avoid JWT Security Pitfalls](https://pragmaticwebsecurity.com/articles/apisecurity/jwt-security-pitfalls.html) - which is probably easier to read than the [Best Practices](BestPractices.md) I dumped here, and was the inspiration to create this repository.
  * And a [presentation](https://pragmaticwebsecurity.com/talks/xssoauth.html) about [The impact of XSS on OAuth 2.0 in SPAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEnbi4KClVw) (YouTube)

* auth0 has a [JWT Handbook](https://auth0.com/resources/ebooks/jwt-handbook) (email required), and it mostly has the same information presented here. 
* As linked in the [Attack Playbook](AttackPlaybook.md) page, the [JWT_Tool](https://github.com/ticarpi/jwt_tool/wiki) is a great resource.
